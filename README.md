# C-plus-plus-Portfolio
•	Developed 500+ lines program in C++ using SFML in Linux environment.  
•	Analyzed tech specification for a variety of algorithms and created working code based on spec provided.  
•	Employed unit testing, industry standard API libraries including Boost for software development process.

<b>Project-1  Hello World with SFML</b>  
The main task in this project is to build a sprite image by getting familiar with SFML and its different libraries.  
In this project I have used an image of squirrel as sprite image. When the arrow keystrokes are used the image responds by moving in that direction. 
The program created, uses SFML’s sprite class for displaying a moving image on SFML window. Also, the sprite image rotates in left direction for L keyword and in right direction for R keyword. 

<b>  Project-2 (part A) LINEAR FEEDBACK SHIFT REGISTER</b>  
The main purpose of this project was to build a Linear Feedback Shift Register which produces pseudo-random bits. I also implemented unit tests using Boost test framework.

<b>Project-2 (part B) LINEAR FEEDBACK SHIFT REGISTERL</b>    
The main purpose of this project was to build a program that encodes/decodes a given image and saves it to the disk.

<b>Project-3 RECURSIVE GRAPHICS (PYTHAGORAS TREE) </b>  
The core task of this project was to build a Pythagoras tree using SFML libraries. The main technique was to create a square and recursively build multiple squares with certain given angles and position at every recursive point. It takes size of the base square and depth of recursion as arguments and an angle to build the tree. The depth is used to determine the number of times the pattern is to be repeated for forming the tree. 

<b>Project-4 (A) N-BODY SIMULATION</b>  
The task given in this project was to implement and display a static universe by reading a text file, which consisted of number of components or planets, radius, and each components position, its velocity, mass and image file name. 

<b>Project-4 (B) N-BODY SIMULATION</b>  
The main task in this project was to used physics simulation and add animation to the previous project. After building the static universe, make the planets move around the sun. This calculation of new positions can be done with the help of data in planets.txt file and implementing the data in the equation.

<b>Project-5 (A) SYNTHESIZING A PLUCKED STRING SOUND</b>  
The main task of this project is to build an algorithm to simulate plucking a guitar string. To test the program, I implemented exception handling mechanism in StringSound implementation. 

<b>Project-5 (B) SYNTHESIZING A PLUCKED STRING SOUND:</b>  
The main idea of this project is to generate a stream of string samples for generating audio under keyboard control, by using Karplus-Strong guitar simulation. That is, too calculate the frequency of the note provided as keyboard input and produce the sound using SFML libraries.

<b>Project-6 DNA SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT </b>   
The main task of this project is to implement a program to find optimal alignment between given 2 strings. To implement this project, I've used dynamic programming approach. Also, to use valgrind, a memory analysis tool and to understand time and space performance of the program

<b>Project-7 MARKOV MODEL OF NATURAL LANGUAGE </b>  
To implement this project, we’ve to build a model which generates reasonable random text, by analyzing the given text and producing a probabilistic model for transitions between k-grams.
